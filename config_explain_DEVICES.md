#### Audio:

Here we set our audio to inject _Layout 1_ - this may or may not be compatible with your codec, but you can check on [_AppleALC's Supported Codec Page_](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs).

Asus ROG SupremeFX S1220A is base on Realteck ALC1220.
Acording to Info.plist on AppleALC Github for ALC1220 layout 1 is for "Toleda - Realtek ALC1220, 5/6 audio ports, native: 2 inputs, 3/4 outputs+front panel+SPDIF/Optical"


#### Graphics:
